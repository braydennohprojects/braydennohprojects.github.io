<h1>Human-River Geomorphic Coupling</h1>
<h3>by Brayden Noh and Omar Wani</h3>

<p>
Meandering rivers attract civilization &mdash; providing food, water, and transportation &mdash; but also destroy it when they shift course. <b>Human-River</b> couples these two forces into a single dynamical system on a cellular automaton.
</p>

<p>
Each cell on a 2D grid is either <b>river</b>, <b>settlement</b>, or <b>empty floodplain</b>. Population is conserved: if the river drowns a settlement, it must relocate. Each cell's <b>utility</b> is
</p>

\[
U(\mathbf{x}, t) \;=\; -\,w_d \, D(\mathbf{x}, t) \;+\; w_c \, C(\mathbf{x}, t)
\]

<p>
where \(D\) is the distance to the nearest river cell, \(C\) is the number of occupied Moore neighbors, and \(w_d, w_c\) are tunable coupling weights. River cells have \(U = -\infty\).
</p>

<p>
Two rules drive the dynamics each timestep:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Bulldozer.</b> Settlements drowned by the migrating river are erased and regrown at the highest-utility perimeter cell.</li>
  <li><b>Crawl.</b> The worst settlement swaps with the best empty perimeter cell, but only if the utility gain exceeds a friction threshold \(\mu\).</li>
</ol>
